## About this Fork

This fork of the `pysparkplug` package, implementing the `Sparkplug-B` specfication, intends to remain interoperability with the specification, while making some aspects of the standard optional, when used internally. Deviations from the standard are:

- retention of birth certificates
- optionally disable Protobuf payload encodings (they are replaced by human-readable JSON payloads)

Furthermore, this fork provides:

- a `HostApplication` class based on the specification
- a `DataOpsNode` class (not described in the specification, but useful from our point of view)
- an automatic rebirthing mechanism for `EdgeNodes` and `Devices`

## Getting Started

### Installation

`pysparkplug` uses the Eclipse Pahoâ„¢ MQTT Python Client, i.e. [`paho-mqtt`](https://github.com/eclipse/paho.mqtt.python), for low-level MQTT communication.

### Usage

Simple demos of the `EdgeNode`, `Device`, and `Client` classes publishing and subscribing all supported payloads and metric datatypes can be found in the `notebooks` directory. To run them dynamically, you'll need to install Docker and run `just notebooks` before opening up your local browser to http://localhost:8888. The password is `bokchoy`.

## Features

### Fully type annotated

`pysparkplug`'s various interfaces are fully type annotated.
